    <h2>What Is Information Technology</h2>
    <p>
        Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data and information. 
        IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).
        An information technology system is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, 
        a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.

    <h2>Technology and Society</h2>
    <p>
      Technology society and life or technology and culture refers to the inter-dependency, co-dependence, 
      co-influence, and co-production of technology and society upon one another.
       Evidence for this synergy has been found since humanity first started using simple tools.
        The inter-relationship has continued as modern technologies such as the printing press and 
        computers have helped shape society. The first scientific approach to this relationship occurred with 
        the development of tektology, the "science of organization", in early twentieth century Imperial Russia.
         In modern academia, the interdisciplinary study of the mutual impacts of science,
       technology, and society, is called science and technology studies.

    <h2> Technology and India </h2>
    <p>
      On 25 June 2002 India and the European Union agreed to bilateral cooperation in the field of science 
      and technology. A joint EU-India group of scholars was formed on 23 November 2001 to further promote
       joint research and development. India holds Associate Member State status at CERN,
       while a joint India-EU Software Education and Development Centre is due at Bangalore.
       Bangalore is considered to be the technological capital of India.
        IT, biotechnology, aerospace, nuclear science, manufacturing technology, automobile engineering, 
        chemical engineering, ship building, space science, electronics, computer science and other medical
         science related research and development are occurring on a large scale in the country.
